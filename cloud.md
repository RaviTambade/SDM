### Benefits of Cloud Computing for Businesses

As a business owner, you look for things to simplify and to make sure your work load is minimal. You wonder how some business owners and company owners maintain their businesses with less staffs. What most companies use is cloud computing for economical savings and less stress.


At some point in your life, you have made use with the cloud. If you use a web-based email provider such as Gmail or Hotmail, you are using the cloud. If you’ve ever used Skype video calling or video interfaces like Vimeo or YouTube, you’ve used the cloud.

If you’ve ever backed up data on the Internet rather than an external device, you’ve used the cloud. Now that you have an idea what it is, understanding the definition won’t be a problem.



Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.

Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on shared computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

Even with the definitions, you are yet to be convinced how it is really improving the businesses and companies surrounding you.


Most businesses are embracing the use of cloud computing at unstoppable rates, and the technology has risen as a new paradigm that has allowed technology companies to offer services to businesses and organizations through the cloud or, more plainly, from their own servers.


There are obviously benefits and advantages these business/company owners are getting from this so called “cloud computing” you are yet to know.

1. Efficiency/Cost Reduction

Cloud computing helps to lower your operating costs, and also helps organizations pace their investments so they avoid big up-front capital expenses and pay monthly as their business scales.

2. Data Security
The attempts to breach the data of any successful organization is becoming common and cloud computing servers are becoming easy targets for the data breach.

6. Quality Control
When the output of a business, in terms of quality is poor, it would affect the business very negatively. A cloud-based system ensures all documents are stored in one place and in a single format. Quality control ensures that despite the number of people that open your content, it remains consistent and free of any form of error

7. Automatic Software Updates
All cloud-based applications have been designed to automatically refresh and update themselves instead of waiting for computer specialists to be on ground and keep refreshing every minute.

Even if they are on ground, how many times would they refresh a day? That will be human abuse. These apps update themselves and you do not need to wait as waiting could be very annoying especially if you do not have the time or energy.

Speed is another great feature of cloud computing. Within a few seconds, you can get any information you so desire from the comfort of your home. All it takes is just keywords entered into the search button and the search is on.

10. Cloud Analytics
Nothing is better than an information that is well organized and well analyzed. Analysis is a very important part of business as it is the strategic and statistical breakdown of your business operations. Cloud analytics can make most businesses effectively scale the storing, processing, and leveraging of data through insights that reflect changing market conditions.

11. Increased Collaboration
What is the aim of business if you cannot work together with people? Cloud computing gives room for increased working together of people in a business. Some organizations even provide cloud based social platform’s where employees can meet, discuss and know what’s up.

12. Disaster Recovery.
This is like a backup procedure for all information and facts collected. No matter how perfectly built or strong your system is, a single crash can delete all information if it is not backed up. Thus, it is important to back up data so that when a crash happens, within minutes, all information will be restored, and work can start again in earnest.

13. Remote Working
This is a whole lot similar to flexibility. You can be at home and be very useful to your business. It boosts productivity as people love to be working in comfort as long as there is a very stable internet connection.

14. IoT Ready
IOT (Internet of Things) can generate massive amounts of data, and cloud computing provides a pathway for this data to travel across. By allowing a lot of developers to store and access data remotely, developers can access data immediately and work on projects without delay. The IOT (Internet of Things) has also helped developers to remotely store and access data immediately and work without delay.


In a business or organization, there is always a story to tell about the success. Cloud computing has been seen as the solution to the problem of some businesses which has led to their being successful today. It helps in our day to day life. Using the internet, Skyping, watching videos on YouTube, even backing up documents without the aid of external disk( like hard disk or flash drive). Cloud computing has been taken useful despite the disadvantages.

Conclusively, cloud computing helps in growing a successful and standard business. In short, cloud is fast becoming the new normal. By the end of 2015, it was estimated that 90% of businesses in the United Kingdom would be using at least one cloud service.

Ensuring you and your team know how to use cloud computing to improve your business might seem difficult but it is well worth the effort of learning and implementing.
